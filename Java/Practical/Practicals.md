# List of Practicals to be done

1. Design a class Complex having a real part (x) and an imaginary part (y). Provide methods to perform the following on complex numbers:

- a. Add two complex numbers.
- b. Multiply two complex numbers.
- c. toString() method to display complex numbers in the form: x + i y

2. Create a class TwoDim which contains private members as x and y coordinates in package P1. Define the default constructor, a parameterized constructor and override toString() method to display the co-ordinates. Now reuse this class and in package P2 create another class ThreeDim, adding a new dimension as z as its private member. Define the constructors for the subclass and override toString() method in the subclass also. Write appropriate methods to show dynamic method dispatch. The main() function should be in a package P.

3. Define an abstract class Shape in package P1. Inherit two more classes: Rectangle in package P2 and Circle in package P3. Write a program to ask the user for the type of shape and then using the concept of dynamic method dispatch, display the area of the appropriate subclass. Also write appropriate methods to read the data. The main() function should not be in any package.

4. Create an exception subclass UnderAge, which prints "Under Age" along with the age value when an object of UnderAge class is printed in the catch statement. Write a class exceptionDemo in which the method test() throws UnderAge exception if the variable age passed to it as argument is less than 18. Write main() method also to show working of the program.

5. Write a program to implement stack. Use exception handling to manage underflow and overflow conditions
